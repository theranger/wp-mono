# Mono Wordpress Theme
This is a complete rewrite for the minimalistic [Cudazi](http://cudazi.com ) Mono theme. Unfortunately original theme seems to be abandoned. It has now be completely rewritten and all the original legacy bloat has been removed . This version uses CSS3 and HTML5 features such as semantic nodes, grid and flexbox. While this theme now does not support all legacy browser versions, the codebase is more clear and loading times are faster.
